# Review of 2026 Syllabi

## Inconsistencies Between Syllabi

- **Attendance Policies**: Allowed unexcused absences vary (CS4310: 6, CS2470: 4, CS3221: 6, GD4000: 3). This is reasonable as it reflects course intensity/requirements (e.g., labs in CS3221/CS2470, project in GD4000).
- **Academic Integrity Wording**: CS4760 has a more permissive stance on using external code/assets with attribution, fitting its project-based nature. Others are stricter, which is appropriate for exams/labs. Reasonable variation.
- **Grading Weights and Structures**: Vary appropriately by course type (e.g., CS4760 pass/no pass, GD4000 focuses on presentations/project).
- **Schedule Formats**: All use similar table structures, but minor HTML errors (missing tags) in CS4760 and GD4000. Tentative schedules align with semester dates, noting MLK Day and Ski Day consistently.
- **Other Sections**: Most sections (e.g., Resources, Accommodations) are nearly identical, which is good for consistency. Dates, instructor info, and links are uniform, promoting a cohesive department feel.
