# Review of 2026 Syllabi

## Internal Consistency Issues

### CS 4310 (Operating Systems)

- Typo: "unversity" should be "university" in Academic Integrity section.
- Typo: "unforseen" should be "unforeseen" in Excused Absences.
- Schedule: Missing closing `</td>` in row for Mar 9: `<td>Due: Advisor Eval 2</tr>` should be `<td>Due: Advisor Eval 2</td></tr>`.

### CS 4760 (Senior Project)

- Incomplete section: "## Week 13 Review" ends with "Based on your" – appears truncated.
- Typo: "unversity" should be "university" in Academic Integrity section.
- Typo: "unforseen" should be "unforeseen" in Excused Absences.
- Typo: "Accomodations" should be "Accommodations" in Resources.
- Phone number: "603-535-3300" vs. "535-3300" in other syllabi – inconsistent, but may be intentional for area code inclusion.
- Schedule: Missing closing `</td>` in row for Mar 9: `<td>Due: Advisor Eval 2</tr>` should be `<td>Due: Advisor Eval 2</td></tr>`.

### CS 2470 (Systems Programming in C/C++)

- Typo: "unversity" should be "university" in Academic Integrity section.
- Typo: "lanuage" should be "language" in Student Learning Outcomes.
- Typo: "unforseen" should be "unforeseen" in Excused Absences.

### CS 3221 (Analysis of Algorithms)

- Typo: "unversity" should be "university" in Academic Integrity section.
- Correct spelling of "unforeseen" in Excused Absences – good.

### GD 4000 (Game Design Workshop)

- Typo: "unforseen" should be "unforeseen" in Excused Absences.
- Schedule: Missing opening `<td>` in row for Feb 2: `<td>Start Working<td>` should be `<td>Start Working</td>`.

## Inconsistencies Between Syllabi

- **Typos and Spelling**: "unversity" vs. "university" – present in CS4310, CS4760, CS2470, CS3221; absent in GD4000. "unforseen" vs. "unforeseen" – present in all except CS3221. "Accomodations" vs. "Accommodations" – only in CS4760. "lanuage" – only in CS2470. These are simple typos that should be standardized to correct spelling for professionalism.
- **Phone Number**: CS4760 includes "603-" prefix; others do not. This might be reasonable if CS4760 is for a different campus or context, but inconsistency could confuse students – consider standardizing.
- **Attendance Policies**: Allowed unexcused absences vary (CS4310: 6, CS2470: 4, CS3221: 6, GD4000: 3). This is reasonable as it reflects course intensity/requirements (e.g., labs in CS3221/CS2470, project in GD4000).
- **Academic Integrity Wording**: CS4760 has a more permissive stance on using external code/assets with attribution, fitting its project-based nature. Others are stricter, which is appropriate for exams/labs. Reasonable variation.
- **Grading Weights and Structures**: Vary appropriately by course type (e.g., CS4760 pass/no pass, GD4000 focuses on presentations/project).
- **Schedule Formats**: All use similar table structures, but minor HTML errors (missing tags) in CS4760 and GD4000. Tentative schedules align with semester dates, noting MLK Day and Ski Day consistently.
- **Other Sections**: Most sections (e.g., Resources, Accommodations) are nearly identical, which is good for consistency. Dates, instructor info, and links are uniform, promoting a cohesive department feel.

Overall, the syllabi are largely consistent in structure and key policies, with variations that make sense for course differences. Primary fixes needed are typo corrections and minor HTML repairs for readability.
