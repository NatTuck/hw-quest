# Review of 2026 Syllabi

After triple-checking the actual syllabus files on disk, no internal consistency issues (such as typos, incomplete sections, or HTML errors) were found in any of the syllabi. All spellings are correct, sections are complete, and HTML is properly formatted.

## Inconsistencies Between Syllabi

- **Phone Number**: All syllabi consistently include the full phone number as "603-535-3300" for Campus Accessibility Services.
- **Attendance Policies**: Allowed unexcused absences vary appropriately by course (CS4310: 6, CS2470: 4, CS3221: 6, GD4000: 3, CS4760: 1). This reflects course intensity/requirements (e.g., labs in CS3221/CS2470, projects in GD4000/CS4760).
- **Academic Integrity Wording**: CS4760 has a more permissive stance on using external code/assets with attribution, fitting its project-based nature. Others are stricter, which is appropriate for exams/labs. Reasonable variation.
- **Grading Weights and Structures**: Vary appropriately by course type (e.g., CS4760 pass/no pass, GD4000 focuses on presentations/project).
- **Schedule Formats**: All use similar table structures. Tentative schedules align with semester dates, noting MLK Day and Ski Day consistently.
- **Other Sections**: Most sections (e.g., Resources, Accommodations) are nearly identical, which is good for consistency. Dates, instructor info, and links are uniform, promoting a cohesive department feel.

Overall, the syllabi are highly consistent in structure and key policies, with variations that make sense for course differences. No fixes are needed.
