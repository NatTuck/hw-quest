<h2>Standard Policies</h2>

<p><strong>Attendance</strong></p>

<p>Attendance is required for all class meetings (whether lectures or labs).
  You must check in to the online attendance tool within 5 minutes of the start
  of the period to receive full attendance credit.</p>

<p>If you are unable to attend class due to a circumstance covered by the
  university <a
    href="https://www.plymouth.edu/sites/default/files/media/2022-11/psu-excused-absence-policy.pdf">
    Excused Absence Policy</a> email the professor as soon as possible for an
  exception. If you reasonably can email before the meeting, you
  must do so to receive an exception.</p>

<p><strong>Late Work</strong></p>

<p>You are expected to submit your assignments by the deadline. Try to get
  stuff done and submitted at least an hour before that so you don't miss the
  deadline due to a browser bug or wifi glitch.</p>

<p>Unless some more specific policy is specified for a specific assignment or
  type of assignment, late work will not be accepted.</p>

<p>If you are unable to complete an assignment on time due to circumstances
  covered by the university <a
    href="https://www.plymouth.edu/sites/default/files/media/2022-11/psu-excused-absence-policy.pdf">
    Excused Absence Policy</a> email the professor as soon as possible for an
  extension. If you reasonably can email before the deadline, you must do so to
  receive an extension.</p>

<p><strong>Letter Grades</strong></p>

<p>
&ge; 93 &rarr; A, &ge; 90 &rarr; A-, <br>
&ge; 87 &rarr; B+, &ge; 83 &rarr; B, &ge; 80 &rarr; B-, <br>
&ge; 77 &rarr; C+, &ge; 73 &rarr; C, &ge; 70 &rarr; C-, <br>
&ge; 67 &rarr; D+, &ge; 63 &rarr; D, &ge; 60 &rarr; D-, <br>
else (&lt; 60) &rarr; F
</p>

<p><strong>Grade Appeals</strong></p>

<p>If you think you received an incorrect grade, send me an email describing
  why your grade is wrong and how you think it should be corrected.</p>

<p>If the grade isn’t clearly wrong, I will ask you to stop by my office hours so
  we can discuss the issue in more detail.</p>

<p>For scores automatically and immediately generated by deterministic test
  scripts on Inkfish, you are expected to review that immediate feedback and
  resubmit with corrections before the due date. Scores where you could have
  done that are unlikely to be modified unless there's a clear error in the
  script.</p>

<p><strong>Academic Integrity</strong></p>

<p>Please carefully read and be familiar with the university <a
  href="https://coursecatalog.plymouth.edu/university-policies-procedures/">
  Academic Integrity Policy</a>.</p>

<p>Especially don’t do any of the things in the list of examples of academic
  integrity violations. Make sure to review the penalties for repeated
  offenses.</p>

<p>The maximum penalty for academic dishonestly is a grade of “AF” in this
  course. In addition, the student’s name may be sumitted the the appropriate
  university authorities for further diciplinary action which may result in
  penalties up to dismissal from the University.</p>

<p>The most likely violation for this course is plagarism, which is when a
  student submits a solution for an assignment that wasn’t produced by them (or
  their assigned team in the case of a group assignment). Both submitting work
  that you didn’t produce and providing solutions to other students are
  unacceptable in this course and will result in a penalty as described
  above.</p>

<p>Some assignments in this course allow the use of generative AI tools. Such
  tools should not be used to generate assignment solutions except as
  explicitly described in a given assignment.</p>

<p><strong>Fair Grading Policy</strong></p>

<p>All grading in this class is subject to the university <a
  href="https://coursecatalog.plymouth.edu/university-policies-procedures/">Fair
  Grading Policy</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Email and Canvas</strong></p>

<p>Some communication about this class will be done through email to your
  University address. Please check your email; you are responsible for any
  email communications you miss.</p>

<p>Other communication - especially to the whole class - will be done through
  Canvas Annoucements. Check those regularly.</p>

<p><strong>ADA Statement</strong>

<p>Plymouth State University is committed to providing students with
  documented disabilities equal access to all university programs and
  facilities. If you think you have a disability requiring accommodations, you
  should contact Campus Accessibility Services (CAS), located in Speare 210
  (535-3300) to determine whether you are eligible for such accommodations.
  Academic accommodations will only be considered for students who have
  registered with CAS. If you have a Letter of Accommodation for this course
  from CAS, please provide the instructor with that information privately so
  that you and the instructor can review those accommodations.</p>

<p><strong>Tutoring</strong></p>

<p>CS&amp;T offers evening tutoring for several classes. Keep an eye out for
  annoucements. The <a
    href="https://www.plymouth.edu/academics/plymouth-academic-support-services">PASS
    Office</a> also offers individual tutoring.</p>

<p><strong>Class Cancellations and Inclement Weather</strong></p>

<p>Class cancellations, if nessisary for whatever reason, will be posted as an
  annoucement on Canvas.</p>

<p>While my goal is to hold class during inclement weather unless the Univesity
  has closed, that isn't always possible. Definitely check canvas for a
  cancellation (or short delay) if the weather report mentions freezing
  rain.</p>

<p>Class cancellations and inclement weather and class cancellations don't
  change assignment deadlines unless explictly noted.</p>

<p><strong>Late Registration</strong></p>

<p>If you register late for the course please contact the professor to discuss
  completing any missed assignments as soon as possible.</p>
