# CS Revision 2026

Changes:

- Fundamentals Changes Drastically
  - Not a prereq for cs2370, but may be a prereq for later
    courses.
  - Doesn't cover circuits
  - Does cover files, CLI usage, and other domain basics.
  - Covers some short topics from ACM core: DB, Networking
- Intermediate Programming
  - Data structures isn't in the name
  - Still cover *using* lists, maps.
  - Needs to cover short topics from ACM core: Graphics, HCI
- Algorithms
  - Data structures is in the name
- Operating Systems
  - Requires C Programming, Not Architecture
- Databases: Gone (-4 credits)
- Calc 2 -> Calc Stats, Basic Stats Gone (-4 credits)
- Added AI (+3)
- Added Programming Languages (also acts as "Advanced Programming") (+3)
- Still need to clean up credit numbers.

**Tweaking Credits**

- Systems Programming wants to be 3 credits, we can add "And security" if we
must.
- That leaves us 1 credit.

- But Elman wants Web Dev & DB.
- Fundamentals could be 2 credits (1 + 1 lab).
- Algo could conceptually be 3 credits (2 + 1 lab); some of the overflow could
get pushed into Theory of Computation.

**Implications for RB, CY, IT**

- Fundamentals is no longer pre-req for Intro to Programming
  - Still may recommend it comes first in course sequence.
- Databases still exists: It's an IT / CY only course.
- Robotics already requires AI; now we can definitely run it.

**Still Want To**

- Figure out 3-year IT, minimizing unique courses.
- See what more overlap we can get between the four majors.
- Stare more closely at what the math reqs are between majors:
  - Can we offer low-math CS, or high math CY, or similar?
  - Do the math reqs for CS/RB want to be the same?
