# Web Chatbots

A variety of companies provide some of their most advanced AI models
as interactive web chatbots, mostly for no fee.

Keep in mind:

- These typically require a user account.
- These are good for straightforward questions, but not as good as other
tools for complex multi-step tasks like software development.
- All of these services save all your interactions for a variety of reasons,
including future training data.

Suggestions:

- [Google AI Studio (Gemini)](https://aistudio.google.com) - Good all-around
chatbot, plus some other models.
- [Claude](https://claude.ai/) - Arguably the best coding models.
- [OpenAI (ChatGPT)](https://chatgpt.com/) - Popular, probably overrated.
- [Twitter (Grok)](https://twitter.com/i/grok) - Surprisingly good at debugging.
- [Mistral](https://chat.mistral.ai/chat) - From France. Releases a bunch of
open source model.
- [Microsoft (Copilot)](https://copilot.microsoft.com/) - The OpenAI models
again.
- [Deepseek](https://www.deepseek.com/en) - From China. A large model.
- [Alibaba (Qwen)](https://chat.qwen.ai/)

## API Coding Tools

The one tool:

- [aider](https://aider.chat) - This provides chat-based programming assistance
using various APIs. I strongly recommend this workflow over IDE integrated
autocompletion approaches.

The APIs gateways:

- [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/) - Provides access to a broad variety of
models, both free and paid.
- Google AI Studio, Claude, etc 


## Local AI tools:

 - ollama
 - llama.cpp
 - [Kobold.cpp](https://github.com/LostRuins/koboldcpp) - Chat interface
