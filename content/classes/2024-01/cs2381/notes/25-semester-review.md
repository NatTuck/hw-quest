**This Semester**

 - Intermediate Programming
 - Data Structures
 - In Java


**Data in Python vs. Java**

 - Core data types are similar:
   - Python: int, float, string, boolean, list, dict, set
   - Java: int, double, String, boolean, ArrayList, HashMap, HashSet
 - Most obvious difference is explicit type declarations.
 - Thats a property of a static vs dynamically typed language.
 - You can't do ```[1, 2, "a", "b"]``` in Java without extra steps.


**Design Recipe**

 - Javadoc
 - Stub
 - Tests
 - Standard pattern
 - Body

A method's type signature generally implies a standard pattern. Show
standard patterns for atomic types, String as atomic, String as sequence.


**Static vs. Instance Methods**

 - Java doesn't have syntactic functions.
 - Everything must be in a class.
 - But it does have static methods.


**Lists**

 - Arrays -> ArrayList
   - ArrayList standard pattern
 - Recursive data -> ConsList
   - ConsList standard patterns (static, instance)
 - Generic type parameters
 - List interface
 - Iterators


**Stacks and Queues**

 - Exist
 

**Threads**

 - Data races
 - Mutexes
 - Deadlocks
 

**Sets**

 - Concept
 - Binary Search Trees
 - Hash Tables


**Dictionaries**

 - Basically like sets.


**Priority Queues**

 - Heaps
 - Graphs
 - Dijkstra's Algo


**Networking / Word Game**

 - You are here.
