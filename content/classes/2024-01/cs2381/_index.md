   [TypingClub](https://www.typingclub.com/) seems like it might be decent.

   - [The Language](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se17/html/index.html)
   - [The Standard Library](
     https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/module-summary.html)
 - Documentation for JavaWorld library:
   - [world.World](http://bryanchadwick.com/javaworld/doc/world/World.html)
   - [image.Image](http://bryanchadwick.com/javaworld/doc/image/Image.html)
   - [The whole thing](http://bryanchadwick.com/javaworld/doc/)
 - Open Licenced Textbooks:
   - [Think Java](https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-java-2e/)

# Useful Stuff:

 - [Mvn Demo App](https://homework.quest/classes/2023-09/cs2381/mvn-demo/)


# Hints:

 - All statements in a Java source file must be inside a method body.
 - On Mac, the tar command will put a bunch of junk in your archives unless
   you [turn Mac junk off](
   https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/9665/create-tar-archive-of-a-directory-except-for-hidden-files).
 - On Mac, it's important that you get the correct version of the JDK for your
   hardware. Are you x64 or aarch64?
 - College is an excellent time to learn to work with desktop Linux.
   Installing Linux Mint on a refurbished laptop is recommended. Look
   for the Thinkpad x260, t460, x270, t470, x280, t480, x390, x395,
   x13, t14 on Amazon or eBay. I got a working x260 off eBay recently
   for $85, including shipping.
