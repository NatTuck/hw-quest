The most hyped computer thing this year is "AI". We happen to have the
tools to mess with it a bit, so let's do that.

```
pip install transformers
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio \
    --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
pip install timm pillow
```

Answer a question:

```python
from transformers import pipeline
import time

t0 = time.time()

qa = pipeline("question-answering")

context = """

My family has several pets.

We have a chicken. Her name is Virginia. We got her used, so I'm not
sure what breed she is exactly.

We have a dog. Her name is Scarlett. She is a boxer mix.

And we have a pet spider. Her name is Kiwi.

"""

question = "What is my dog's name?"

answer = qa(question=question, context=context)

t1 = time.time()
print("runtime:", round(t1-t0, 2))

print(answer)
```

```python
from transformers import pipeline
from PIL import Image

img = Image.open("/home/nat/Pictures/digital-art-wolf-moon-three-wallpaper.jpg")

od = pipeline('object-detection')
result = od(img)

print(result)
```


VQA example:

```python
from transformers import pipeline
from PIL import Image

vqa = pipeline(model="dandelin/vilt-b32-finetuned-vqa")

img = Image.open("/home/nat/Pictures/digital-art-wolf-moon-three-wallpaper.jpg")

answer = vqa(question="How many wolves are there?", image=img)
```
