## Simple Design with Lists

 - Given a list of integers and an integer, determine how many times
   the integer appears in the list.
 - Given a list of integers, produce a list showing the number of
   times the list in that position in the input appears in the input.
   Example: [4,4,4,1,1] -> [3,3,3,2,2]
 - Finding prime numbers.


## Tuples

A sheep is a pair (name, color). Write a function that counts the pink
sheep in a list.


## Pyglet

From the hw03 starter code, using the Pyglet docs, write a program
in which a circle bounces around the window.
