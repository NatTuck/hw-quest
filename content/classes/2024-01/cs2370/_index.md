# Suggested Resources

 - If you're not comfortable touch typing, now's a good time to learn that skill.

# Hints:

 - College is an excellent time to learn to work with desktop Linux.
   Installing Linux Mint on a refurbished laptop is recommended. Look
   for the Thinkpad x260, t460, x270, t470, x280, t480, x390, x395,
   x13, t14 on Amazon or eBay. I got a working x260 off eBay recently
   for $85, including shipping.
