- This is CS 2010, Computing Fundamentals
- I am Nat Tuck

**Rant: Academic Address**

- This is a first-year class, so I might as well go over academic address in
case nobody else does.
- My name is Nat Tuck
- My academic titles are Doctor (because I have a PhD) and Professor (because
I'm teaching a college class that you are in, and also because my job title here
is Assistant Professor).
- So you could call me "Dr Tuck" or "Prof Tuck".
- Dr. Tuck is correct for me, but might be wrong for other instructors who don't
have PhDs. So your best formal choice is "Professor Tuck", which is valid for
all college instructors.
- "Mr Tuck" is incorrect, because we're in an academic setting and I have at
least one applicable academic title.
- Professor is great too because not only is it always correct academic address,
the next step is frequently trying to guess between Miss, Mrs, or Ms - so the
odds are you'll end getting it doubly wrong.

That all being said, feel free to call me Nat.

**What's Computing Fundamentals**

We're going to talk mostly about two broad topics this semester:

- How does computer hardware work to store data and run programs. Electricity is
involved, as well as really heavily processed sand.
- How are computer programs written. Typically, you type them with a keyboard,
although we'll also look at how to get the computer to write them for you.

**Attendance**

- Today I'll be taking attendance manually.
- Starting on Friday, we'll be using a tool called Inkfish to take attendance.
Bring a device and punch in the code in the first 5 minutes of class or you
lose attendance points.
- Get at least one device (phone works) signed into Inkfish and signed up for
the class before Friday.

**Course Site and Syllabus**

- My web site is https://homework.quest/
- Go there, and then click CS 2010.
- Let's look at the syllabus.

**Lab This Afternoon**

- Half of you have lab this afternoon. The rest of you will do this on Friday.
- We're going to be installing Minecraft on the lab computers.
- Either get a Minecraft account before lab or bring a credit card. The game is
$30.
- There's no Monday next week, so lab order will flip for a while.

**Homework 1**

- Get Minecraft installed on your personal PC.
- Typing Practice.
- Due end of day on Sunday. Note: You're not allowed to do homework after it's
due, but you can do it before then.
