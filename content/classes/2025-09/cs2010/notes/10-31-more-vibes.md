## Vibe Coding Turtle Programs

### Get People to Sign Up for OpenRouter Now

- Openrouter.ai
- Put in $10 before lab. Fully free accounts get throttled hard,
  and online payments sometimes take hours to go through.

### Second Vibe Coding Example

- Get a turtle, get a terminal in its disk directory.
- Clone the git repo from <https://github.com/NatTuck/turtles25>
- Run aider
- Note that Aider needs a git repo to work in.

Today's task: Deforestation

- Our turtle should clear trees in a square to the front and right
  of its starting point.
- How?
- Rather than just giving a simple prompt and hoping for the best,
  we're going to think about this in stages, test, and revise.

Here are some stages:

- Covering a square.
- Tree detection
- Wood detection
- Wood chopping
- Position tracking (dead reckoning)
- Return to square covering.
