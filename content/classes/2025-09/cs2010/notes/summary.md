# Topics Covered in CS2010: Computing Fundamentals (Fall 2025)

## Computer Hardware Fundamentals (Early September)
- Binary numbers, base conversions (binary, hex, decimal).
- Boolean logic: AND, OR, NOT; truth tables.
- Logic gates and circuits in Minecraft/Redstone.
- Designing circuits: sum-of-products, Boolean algebra simplification.
- Karnaugh maps (K-maps) for circuit optimization.
- Seven-segment displays.
- Negative numbers (two's complement), floating-point representation.
- Memory: D flip-flops, registers.
- Clocks and counters.
- CPU outline: ALU, register file, memory, instruction execution.

## Midterm Review and Exam (Early October)
- Review of hardware topics.
- Midterm exam.

## Programming Introduction with Lua and ComputerCraft Turtles (Mid-October)
- Lua basics: REPL, data types (numbers, strings, tables), variables.
- Turtle commands: movement, digging, placing blocks.
- Control structures: while loops, for loops, if statements.
- Functions and abstraction.
- Tree chopping programs.

## Version Control and Collaboration (Late October)
- Git basics: init, add, commit, log, checkout.
- GitHub: forking, branching, pull requests, merge conflicts.

## AI-Assisted "Vibe" Coding (Late October)
- Using Aider with LLMs (e.g., OpenRouter, Qwen Coder) for turtle programs.
- Iterative development: square coverage, tree detection, chopping, dead reckoning.

## Advanced Turtle Programming (Early November)
- Dead reckoning: position and direction tracking.
- Recursive tree chopping.
- Variable scope and environments in Lua.

## Networking and Web (Mid-November)
- Internet basics: DNS, IP, TCP, HTTP/HTTPS.
- ComputerCraft HTTP client: fetching and parsing data.
- Drawing images from online text files.
- Web servers and applications (intro to Lapis in Lua).

## Careers and Majors (Early December)
- Comparison of CS, IT, Robotics, Math majors.
- Job outcomes, recommendations (projects, grad school, etc.).

This summary is derived from the class notes. The course emphasized hands-on Minecraft labs for hardware simulation and turtle programming, with a shift from low-level hardware to software and web concepts post-midterm.
