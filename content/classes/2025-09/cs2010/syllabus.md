[&larr; Back to Course Site](../)

<blockquote>
<b>Course Catalog:</b><br>
To explore some topical applications and technologies such as
robotics, artificial intelligence, and networking, examines some of
the fundamental aspects of computing, including how a computing
machine stores, manipulates, and transforms numbers, words, images,
and sounds, changing them from mere data into useful information;
strategies for solving computational problems (algorithmic thinking);
expressing computational solutions in various computer languages from
assembly through icon-driven graphical languages (4GLs); historical,
social and theoretical issues. Includes a weekly hands-on lab through
which students experience a variety of computing environments.

**Labs**

Each week there will be a lab assignment to complete during the lab
period. Labs will only be accepted before the end of the lab period,
and only when submitted from a lab workstation.

This course is a pre-requisite for several other courses. Labs are
intended to help you personally practice specific skills without
outside help.

Towards that end:

- Personal electronics may not be used. If they are brought to
   lab, they must be kept in a closed container like a backpack.
- Only approved web resources can be used. That includes the course
   web site, the textbook, the LMS, and nothing else unless explicitly
   listed in the assignment.
- Students who intentionally or repeatedly violate this policy will
   be asked to leave and will not be able to complete that lab
   assignment.

**Homework**

Each week there will be a homework assignment to be completed outside
of class.

Each assignment will have guidelines on what resources to use. Follow the
guidelines and complete the assignment as instructed.

Assignments submitted after the deadline will not be accepted, unless submission
was prevented by an unexpected event that would qualify as an excused absence.
Start early to ensure you have enough time to complete the assignments.

There may be extra assignments that are counted as homework for
administrative tasks like completing course evaluations.

**Exams**

There will be two exams, a midterm and a final.

The exams will most likely be on paper, with no access to electronic
resources.

Graded exams can be reviewed during office hours or by appointment.
