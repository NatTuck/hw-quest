[&larr; Back to Course Site](../)

<blockquote>
<b>Course Catalog:</b><br>
A second programming course which reinforces the programming
constructs learned in CS 2370 and covers more advanced programming
techniques. Students learn about the client/server paradigm, how to
create graphical user interfaces and event-driven program structure,
and how to use basic data structures such as stacks, queues, lists,
and trees. Students write applications using basic networking and
multithreading techniques. Three lecture hours and 2 hours of computer
lab. Falls and Springs.
<br>Prereq: CS2370

## Student Learning Outcomes

Successful students will: 

- Understand how to structure data in computer programs, including
  the roles of several common data structures.
- Be comfortable writing medium-sized programs in a modern
  programming language like Java.
- Be able to determine the computational complexity of many
  operations and algorithms.
- Practice reading and understanding computer code.
- Consider creative solutions to programming problems.

## Texts

We will be using the following free online textbooks:

- [Think Java 2nd Edition](https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-java-2e/)
- [Think Data Structures](https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-data-structures/)

## Required Materials

- [OpenRouter Credits ($10)](https://openrouter.ai/)

The number of points available in an assessment may (or may not)
exceed the denominator used in the grade calculation. For example, if
the final exam offers 104 points out of 100, then a perfect score
would count as 26% towards the final course grade.

**Labs**

Each week there will be a lab assignment to complete during the lab
period. Labs will only be accepted before the end of the lab period,
and only when submitted from a lab workstation.

The purpose of this course is to teach the skill of computer
programming. Students need to practice writing programs themselves
without external help. Therefore, the following rules apply to
lab sessions:

 - Personal electronics may not be used. If they are brought to
   lab, they must be kept in a closed container like a backpack.
 - Only approved web resources can be used: Inkfish, the course site,
   provided lecture notes, the textbooks(s), the offical programming
   language documentation, and anything directly linked from the
   current lab assignment.
 - Students who intentionally or repeatedly violate this policy will
   be asked to leave and will not be able to complete that lab
   assignment.
 - These specific rules may be overridden by the instructions in
   individual lab assignments.

**Homework**

Each week there will be a homework assignment to be completed outside
of class.

The intent of homework assignments is to learn and practice personal programming
skills. You must complete homework either on your own or in assigned teams, and
should not use external tools to generate solutions except as described in the
assignments.

Homeworks submitted after the deadline loses 1% per hour late (round
up).

There may be extra assignments that are counted as homework for
administrative tasks like completing course evaluations.

**Inkfish and Script Grades**

Labs and homework will be provided through an online web application called
Inkfish and must be submitted through the same system. Emailed submissions do
not count for credit.

A portion of your grade for labs and homework assignments may be
generated by an automatic grading script which runs when you submit
your work. Unless there is a clear bug ðŸª³ in the script, the script
output is that portion of your grade and will not be adjusted
manually. You are being graded on getting the script to give you
points. You should review the output, make corrections, and resubmit
before the deadline if you are unhappy with the script results.

Script grades will be reduced if you submit work inconsistent with the
text or spirit of the assignment, such as hard-coding outputs that
should be calculated.

Feedback on your code will be additionally provided both manually and through
the use of automated bots. Automated feedback will be marked as such, and any
concerns about its correctness should be handled through the grade appeal
process described below.

**Teams**

You may be assigned to work with a partner, in which case pair
programming is required. In assigning partners, sometimes there ends
up being a team of one or (under rare circumstances) three.

All team members are responsible for and get credit for any work
submitted as a team.

**Final Exam**

The final exam will be on paper. Be prepared to write both English and
code.

No electronics are allowed in exams.

Graded exams can be reviewed during office hours or by appointment.
