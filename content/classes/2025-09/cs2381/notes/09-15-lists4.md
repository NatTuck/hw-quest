**Last Time**

We started List implementation with a singly linked list, trying to
get bubble sort to work.

**This Time**

- Finish the implementation.
- Just build get and set, then complain that they're O(n).

**Build Simple ArrayWrap**

- Complain that a proper iterator for a singly linked list would be awful.
- Build Iterator for ArrayWrap.
- Then build ListIterator
