# Hints:

 - If you're not comfortable touch typing, now's a good time to learn that skill.
   [TypingClub](https://www.typingclub.com/) seems like it might be decent.
 - All statements in a Java source file must be inside a method body.
 - On Mac, the tar command will put a bunch of junk in your archives unless
   you [turn Mac junk off](
   https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/9665/create-tar-archive-of-a-directory-except-for-hidden-files).
 - On Mac, it's important that you get the correct version of the JDK for your
   hardware. Are you x64 or aarch64?
 - College is an excellent time to learn to work with desktop Linux.
   Installing Linux Mint on a refurbished laptop is recommended. Look
   for the Thinkpad x13 or t14 on Amazon or eBay.
