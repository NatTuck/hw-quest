## Student Learning Outcomes

Successful students will: 

 - Work in a team to develop a complex web application.
 - Publish the resulting application as a public git repository
   released under an open source license.
 - Use a selection of specific tools, techniques, and methodologies
   for software engineering, software development, and project
   management.
 - Engage in self-directed learning to gain knowlege and experience
   with new web development languages, frameworks, libraries, and
   tools.
 - Discover project tasks and break large tasks down into smaller pieces.
 - Contribute to allocation of tasks between team members then
   personally do a fair share of the work.
 - Deploy to a commodity virtual private server.
 - Collect and implement user stories.


## Texts

There is no required textbook ðŸª³ for this course.


## Course Materials

During the course of the semester, each student will be required to purchase the
following services:

 - A commodity virtual private server for the full semester.
 - A domain name
 - A $10 credit on OpenRouter.

This can be done for under $30.

Please wait to get these until the task is assigned, as there are
several specific requirements.


## Software Project

In this course you will work in a team to build a software project.

This semester the plan is for the whole class to work as one big team to build a
single application using a simple agile methodology. Tools and processes will be
introduced as we go.

A major focus of this class is on the elements of software development
other than writing application code, so expect those things to take a
significant portion of your time and effort in this class.

The number of points available in an assessment may (or may not)
exceed the denominator used in the grade calculation.

**Letter grades**

&ge; 93 &rarr; A, &ge; 90 &rarr; A-, <br>
&ge; 87 &rarr; B+, &ge; 83 &rarr; B, &ge; 80 &rarr; B-, <br>
&ge; 77 &rarr; C+, &ge; 73 &rarr; C, &ge; 70 &rarr; C-, <br>
&ge; 67 &rarr; D+, &ge; 63 &rarr; D, &ge; 60 &rarr; D-, <br>
else (&lt; 60) &rarr; F

**Final Presentation**

At the end of the semester each student (or small group) will give a
presentation on something interesting they did during during the semester. The
grade for this will cover both the presentation itself and the work it
describes.

A component of this grade may be from peer evaluations.

**Semester Checklist**

Over the course of the semester you must accomplish a set of specific tasks
(e.g. creating some number of pull requests, doing code reviews, working on
specific components of the app).

The full checklist will be available by mid-semester, and you'll have to submit
a summary at the end of the semester showing what you did to satisfy the
checklist requirements.

**Weekly Reports**

Each week you'll have to write a quick report summarizing what you did that
week.

**Project Tasks**

Each week you'll be assigned multiple specific tasks to complete. There will be
some overlap in grading between completing tasks and summarizing those tasks in
your weekly report.

**Peer Evaluation**

Some of your tasks will be to evaluate work done by your classmates, both in the
form of code reviews and checklist-based confirmation of task completion.

This means your work will be evaluated by peers as well. In many cases, these
evaluations will directly become task scores and influence final grades. Do the
best you can to provide a fair and accurate evaluation.

**Late Work**

Please start early and submit your work on time.

In many cases other students won't be able to start their tasks until you
complete yours. Please try to avoid inconveniencing your classmates.

The penalty for late submission will be whatever the submission tool (Inkfish,
Canvas, or maybe something else) is configured to impose. This may be no credit
for late work, half credit for work submitted no more than 1 day late, or some
other penalty. Assume no credit for late work unless otherwise specified.

# Copyright and Attribution

To avoid plagarism, the following are clearly OK:

 - If a member of your team wrote code.
 - If a member of your team generated boilerplate code with a non-AI
   code generation tool (e.g. mix phx.gen.html in Phoenix)
 - Using external open source libraries through package management
   tools.

Copying code from other sources is OK if you provide clear attribution
and:

- The code is a documentation sample clearly intended to be adapted and used by
developers OR the code is licensed under an open source license compatible with
your project license. Make sure to follow the license.
- Attribution should be identify the author if possible, how to find the
resource (e.g. URL, book citation, etc), and any relevant licensing info.

Using code produced by generative AI is OK as long as:

- You specify what generative AI tool (e.g. name, url, version, date
  as appropriate) was used for what code.
- The default aider commit comment is sufficient. 

Not OK:

- Copying code you didn't produce yourself into your project without
  clear attribution.
- Copyright infringement (including for non-code assets)
- Getting other people to write code for you, especially non-classmates.
