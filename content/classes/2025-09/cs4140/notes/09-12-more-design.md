## Continuous Integration

- Should be working now.
  - Not sure why the Erlang image needs ubuntu22; probably we can get a later
    version of that eventually.
  - Needed to map the postgres port.
- Our goal now is to try to keep the tests passing.

## Goal Today

- Review the design ideas from last week.
- Try to break them down into as many stories as we can come up with such that:
  - Stories can be completed (written, reviewed, etc) before next Friday.
  - Dependencies are explicit and minimal.
  - Each student gets a story.

Initial UI: LiveView

Initial data: Ecto schemas, including embedded schemas.
