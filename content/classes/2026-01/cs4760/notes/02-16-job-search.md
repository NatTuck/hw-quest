## Today: How to Find a Job

Recommendation: "Land the Tech Job You Love, Andy Lester"

- When Drexel teaches this, he makes is officially a recommended
textbook.
- It's 200 pages thinking through the process of finding the
right job and effectively applying for it.

You should get a copy and read the book, but let me cover some key points.

## PSU Resources

- The Career Development Office
- Handshake Job Posts

## Job Applications

The basic sequence:

- Be related to someone who owns a company and tell them exactly what job you
want them to hire you for. Personally, I'd take software R&D, but maybe you want
to be head of IT.

More typically though:

- Find a bunch of job postings.
- Compare them, and figure out which ones you want to apply to.
- Submit job applications, typically including:
  - Resume
  - Cover letter
  - Portfolio
- Get random seeming responses.
- Attend interviews
- Get one offer at a time

## What job postings to look for?

- What skills do you have?
- What are you interested in doing?
- Are you willing to move? What limitations? Dubai?

## Where to look for postings?

- Plymouth State: Handshake
- Job Search Sites: Linked in, Monster, etc.
- Nah, just ask Gemini

## Resume

- Provide accurate information
- LLMs exist, so you can automatically customize to
each job opening.

## Cover Letter

"You should hire me because I can provide the following value to your busienss:
stuff. I have done cool stuff, like: stuff"

## Portfolio

What cool stuff have you done?

If not requested, you can put a link in your cover latter.

## You've put in applications

- You'll get responses.
- They'll be seemingly random. Expect to put in 10 applications
and get one response from whichever opening is the least obvious match.
- Plan for that.

## Interviews

- Job interviews used to be a big deal.
- Read the book for the long version.
- I'm not sure interview questions matter as much today. Just be honest about
what problems you can solve. Explain *how* to solve problems.

## Job Offers

- After an interview, there's a risk of getting a job offer.
- Problem: Once you've accepted an offer, you're potentially with the job search
and future job offers are a problem.
- Solution: Very carefully evaluate the tradeoffs of personal honor and then do
whatever is best for you.
