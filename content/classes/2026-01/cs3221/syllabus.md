The number of points available in an assessment may (or may not)
exceed the denominator used in the grade calculation. For example, if
the final exam offers 104 points out of 100, then a perfect score
would count as 26% towards the final course grade.

**Letter grades**

&ge; 93 &rarr; A, &ge; 90 &rarr; A-, <br>
&ge; 87 &rarr; B+, &ge; 83 &rarr; B, &ge; 80 &rarr; B-, <br>
&ge; 77 &rarr; C+, &ge; 73 &rarr; C, &ge; 70 &rarr; C-, <br>
&ge; 67 &rarr; D+, &ge; 63 &rarr; D, &ge; 60 &rarr; D-, <br>
else (&lt; 60) &rarr; F

**Attendance**

Attendance is required for all class meetings. You must check in to the online
attendance tool within 5 minutes of the start of the period to receive credit
for attendance. If you miss more than six meetings then each subsequent
unexcused absence will reduce your final grade by 4 percentage points.

There are no makeups for unexcused exam or lab absences.

**Problem Sets**

Approximately each week there will be a problem set assignment to be completed
outside of class. Problem sets will involve a combination of written question
and small programming tasks.

Minimizing the use of external resources is recommended, and academic honesty
rules will be strictly enforced.

Problem sets will be posted on Inkfish. Check Inkfish regularly for upcoming due
dates.

Problem sets submitted after the deadline loses 1% per hour late (round up) to a
maximum penalty of 100%.

**Labs**

We have a lab meeting each week, and in most lab meetings there will be a lab
assignment to complete during the class period. Labs will only be accepted
before the end of the lab period, and only when submitted from a lab
workstation, unless alternate instructions are explicitly given.

The purpose of this course is to teach algorithm analysis. Students need to
practice evaluating algorithms themselves. Therefore, the following rules apply
to lab assignments:

- Personal electronics may not be used. If they are brought to
   lab, they must be kept in a closed container like a backpack.
- Only approved web resources can be used: Inkfish, the course site,
   provided lecture notes, the textbooks(s), the official programming
   language documentation, and anything directly linked from the
   current lab assignment.
- That means no Google and definitely no LLM Chatbots during labs.
- Students who intentionally or repeatedly violate this policy will
   be asked to leave and will not be able to complete that lab
   assignment.
- These specific rules may be overridden by the instructions in
   individual lab assignments.

**Exams**

There will be three written exams, each potentially covering any material in the
class although with extra weight towards material not covered on previous exams.

Exams will involve writing answers to questions on paper.

Exam rules:

- Personal electronics may not be used. If they are brought to the exam, they
must be kept in a closed container like a backpack.
- Your written notes on paper are allowed, as are printouts of any provided
course materials.

**Inkfish and Script Grades**

Labs and problem sets will be provided through an online web application called
Inkfish and must be submitted through the same system. Any solutions for lab or
problem set assignment sent by email will not be accepted and will incur a 5%
grade penalty on the associated assignment unless the solution is sent as a
direct reply to an email requesting it.

A portion of your grade for labs and homework assignments may be generated by an
automatic grading script which runs when you submit your work. Unless there is a
clear bug 🪳 in the script, the script output is that portion of your grade and
will not be adjusted manually. You are being graded on getting the script to
give you points. You should review the output, make corrections, and resubmit
before the deadline if you are unhappy with the script results.

Script grades will be reduced if you submit work inconsistent with the text or
spirit of the assignment, such as hard-coding outputs that should be calculated.

**Teams**

You may be assigned to work with a partner. In such cases, actually working
together on each task is required. In assigning partners, sometimes there ends
up being a team of one or (under rare circumstances) three.

All team members are responsible for and get credit for any work submitted as a
team. Keep in mind that pair programming means you should not be doing work for
team assignments on your own.

**Grade Appeals**

If you think you received an incorrect grade, send me an email
describing why your grade is wrong and how you think it should be
corrected.

If the grade isn't clearly wrong, I will ask you to stop by my office
hours so we can discuss the issue in more detail.

Any grade concerns must be raised within two weeks of the grade being
posted.

**Fair Grading Policy**

All grading in this class is subject to the university [Fair Grading Policy](
https://coursecatalog.plymouth.edu/university-policies-procedures/).

**Excused Absences**

Absences will be excused and make-up work allowed only for absences
covered by the university [Excused Absence Policy](
https://campus.plymouth.edu/faculty-governance/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2017/05/PSU-Excused-Absence-Policy.pdf).

If you know you will be missing a class meeting in advance you must
contact the professor before the meeting. For unforeseen and unavoidable
absences, please contact the professor as soon as reasonably possible.

**Late Registration**

If you register late for the course please contact the professor to
discuss completing any missed assignments as soon as possible.

**Course Evaluations**

Course evaluations can be a valuable tool to determine how the
semester went. They're more useful with a higher response rate. You
should do your course evaluations.

## Resources

### Tutoring

There should be evening tutoring offered by the college. See the course website
for more details. The [PASS Office](
https://www.plymouth.edu/academics/plymouth-academic-support-services)
also offers individual tutoring.

### Accomodations

Plymouth State University is committed to providing students with documented
disabilities equal access to all university programs and facilities. If you
think you have a disability requiring accommodations, you should contact Campus
Accessibility Services (CAS), located in Speare (603-535-3300) to determine
whether you are eligible for such accommodations. Academic accommodations will
only be considered for students who have registered with CAS. If you have
authorized CAS to electronically deliver a Letter of Accommodations for this
course, please communicate with your instructor to review your accommodations.

## Academic Integrity

Please carefully read and be familiar with the unversity [Academic
Integrity Policy](
https://coursecatalog.plymouth.edu/university-policies-procedures/).
Especially don't do any of the things in the list of examples of
academic integrity violations. Make sure to review the penalties for
repeated offenses.

The primary subject of this class is writing small computer programs.
In order to learn that skill, you need to practice it by completing
the programming assignments by writing code yourself (or with your
team on team assignments).

Do not:

- Submit stuff that was written for an assignment in this class by someone
who is not on your team.
- Share solutions code for any assignment in this class with anyone who
is not on your team.
- Post solutions for assignments in this class publicly.
- Access unauthorized resources in a lab or exam.
- Search the web for solutions to assignments in this class or similar classes.

Do:

- Use starter code and small snippets from official documentation as a starting
point for your solutions.
- (On problem sets, not in labs) Ask LLM chatbots questions to clarify concepts and
give short code samples to illustrate specifics.

Cheating will be handled as follows:

- During an exam or lab, if you are caught cheating or acting in a
way that appears to facilitate cheating (e.g. using unauthorized
electronics) you will be asked to leave and will not be allowed to
complete the assignment. In lab, you may get a warning first.
- The default penalty for cheating on any assignment is zero grade on
that assignment.

Partner assignment are expected to be done working together. If your
partner cheated on an assignment and submitted it without you seeing,
you still get a zero on that assignment.

## Tentative Schedule

The initial plan is to have problem sets due at end-of-day Wednesday.
