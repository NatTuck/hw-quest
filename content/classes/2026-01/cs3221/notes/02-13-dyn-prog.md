Backtracking / search problems tend to be O(2^n). That's slow.

But many of them have shared subproblems. If we can exploit that,
we can go much faster.

## Fib

- Recursive
- Memoize
- Table
- prev0, prev1

## Longest Increasing Subsequence

- We've got a list of numbers.
- We want to find the longest increasing subsequence.

## Work through some variants

- Recursive
- Memoize
- Memoize 2
- Table?
