**Investigating License Concerns**

I'm currently verifying the open-source license details for Phaser, addressing the initial user inquiry. Following this, I plan to identify and describe several other popular, permissively licensed open-source 2D game engines and libraries suitable for both in-browser and mobile development, including PixiJS and the 2D capabilities of Babylon.js.


**Analyzing Alternative Engines**

I've expanded my focus to include several other open-source 2D engines and libraries beyond the initial list. I'm now investigating the rendering approaches of each, specifically how they handle reactive and functional-style implementations. I'm also checking compatibility with Vite, a Node.js backend using Socket.IO for multiplayer, and ensuring a single-page app structure, all while maintaining a 100% open-source development focus to propose the user an alternative.


**Defining the Scope**

I'm currently focused on defining the parameters of this open-source game development stack. The user needs an in-browser 2D game environment, aiming for full open-source, with mobile compatibility in mind. I'm exploring a single-page architecture built on Vite, while leaning towards Node.js for server-side Javascript with websocket multiplayer to handle this requirement.


**Confirming Open-Source Status**

I've clarified the open-source status of Phaser, citing the search results to address the user's "sketchy" concern. It's truly open-source under MIT. Now, I'm forming a complete stack proposal that meets all the criteria, including alternative rendering engines to offer choices, while explicitly acknowledging this point.


**Refining the Proposal**

I'm now putting together the core stack proposal. I'm focusing on the user's suggestions of Vite for the build tool and Node.js with Socket.IO for the backend and websocket multiplayer. I'm also addressing their concerns about Phaser by presenting PixiJS as a performant, lightweight alternative for 2D rendering, and Babylon.js, although 3D-focused, which also has great 2D functionality.


**Developing Alternatives**

I'm now expanding the core stack proposal. Having validated Phaser's open-source status, I'm integrating the user's suggestions of Vite for the build process and Node.js with Socket.IO for the backend and websocket multiplayer. I'm focusing on open-source alternatives for the rendering engine: PixiJS, Babylon.js, and Godot Engine's HTML5 export. I plan to detail how reactive functional-style rendering fits into this setup using a central state store and rendering engine loop.


**Structuring the Response**

I'm now outlining a clear and comprehensive response. I'll begin by directly addressing the Phaser concern, reaffirming its open-source status under MIT. Then, I will propose a complete open-source stack using the user's preferred Vite, Node.js with Socket.IO, and detail alternatives like PixiJS, Babylon.js, and Godot Engine for rendering, keeping mobile compatibility in mind. I'm focusing on explaining how the reactive, functional rendering concept fits into the stack.
