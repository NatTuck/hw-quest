<blockquote>
<b>Course Catalog:</b><br>
Students will work in teams to create a fully realized video game that addresses
a particular challenge and set of conditions. Each project team is responsible
for taking a game through the development process: from initial concept design
to prototyping, playtesting, refinement, and final delivery. Project constraints
will be provided by the instructor.
<br>Prerequisite(s): CS 2370

**Presentations**

For each of these presentations, the team will present a summary of the current
status and then each team member will highlight their major personal
contributions.

- Concept / early prototype. Demonstrates the game concept, including a function
tech demo showing the core technology or game mechanic.
- Alpha prototype. Playable version of the game featuring the core mechanic that
can be used for playtesting with people outside the design team.
- Progress check-in. Core mechanic is solid. Game art and sound are partially
implemented. Game is at least half done.
- Final presentation: Game is done, including full source code and all assets.
Team presents a post-mortem assessment.

**Production Documents**

- Project Charter - Describes what, how, and time commitments.
- Post-mortem
- Team / peer evaluation

**Final Game Grade**

At the end of the semester your team will submit your completed game, including
all the source code and assets necessary to build and run it.
Your grade for this will include the following elements:

- Did you submit a complete and working game?
- Did you complete the game you proposed, with appropriate adjustment of scope
(larger or smaller) as the semester progressed?
- Did you personally put in serious and effective time and effort on the
project?

**Attendance**

Attendance is required for all class meetings. You must check in to the online
attendance tool within 5 minutes of the start of the period to receive credit
for attendance. If you miss more than three meetings then each subsequent
unexcused absence will reduce your final grade by 4 percentage points.

No makeups for unexcused absences on presentation days.

**Inkfish**

Work will be submitted through an online web application called Inkfish. A 1%
per hour penalty will be assigned for late work, except for the last assignment
of the semester which must be submitted on time for credit.

**Grade Appeals**

If you think you received an incorrect grade, send me an email
describing why your grade is wrong and how you think it should be
corrected.

If the grade isn't clearly wrong, I will ask you to stop by my office
hours so we can discuss the issue in more detail.

Any grade concerns must be raised within two weeks of the grade being
posted.

**Fair Grading Policy**

All grading in this class is subject to the university [Fair Grading Policy](
https://coursecatalog.plymouth.edu/university-policies-procedures/).

**Excused Absences**

Absences will be excused and make-up work allowed only for absences
covered by the university [Excused Absence Policy](
https://campus.plymouth.edu/faculty-governance/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2017/05/PSU-Excused-Absence-Policy.pdf).

If you know you will be missing a class meeting in advance you must
contact the professor before the meeting. For unforeseen an unavoidable
absences, please contact the professor as soon as reasonably possible.

**Late Registration**

If you register late for the course please contact the professor to
discuss completing any missed assignments as soon as possible.

**Course Evaluations**

Course evaluations can be a valuable tool to determine how the
semester went. They're more useful with a higher response rate. You
should do your course evaluations.

## Resources

### Accommodations

Plymouth State University is committed to providing students with documented
disabilities equal access to all university programs and facilities. If you
think you have a disability requiring accommodations, you should contact Campus
Accessibility Services (CAS), located in Speare (603-535-3300) to determine
whether you are eligible for such accommodations. Academic accommodations will
only be considered for students who have registered with CAS. If you have
authorized CAS to electronically deliver a Letter of Accommodations for this
course, please communicate with your instructor to review your accommodations.

## Academic Integrity

Please carefully read and be familiar with the university [Academic
Integrity Policy](
https://coursecatalog.plymouth.edu/university-policies-procedures/).
Especially don't do any of the things in the list of examples of
academic integrity violations. Make sure to review the penalties for
repeated offenses.

Do not:

- Use code or other assets written by someone not on your team unless appropriately
licensed and credited.
- Use computer-generated code or other assets without proper credit.

Notes:

- Using a code library through a standard packing tool is sufficient credit
unless the license specifically requires more than that.
- Open source code generation tools presumptively allow you to use them unless
there's clear evidence otherwise.

## Tentative Schedule
