This is GD4000, Game Design Seminar.

Course website: <https://homework.quest/>

You're going to work together as a team to build a game.

If we had more people, we might have more teams, but with three that's one team.

## Semester Plan

- This week: Figure out what we're doing, when we're meeting, and when you're
all meeting each week.
- Week 02: Figure out what game you're building and how.
- Week 03: Finish project charter, start working.
- Week 05: Present Proof of Concept
- Week 08: Present Alpha
- Week 11: Present Half Done Game
- Finals Week: Submit and Present Completed Game

## Idea: Tool Selection

- Previously this class required GameMaker
- This semester, you'll pick (and justify) your dev tool choices.
- Options other than GameMaker might be better.

## Rest of Period

- Who are you?
- What kind of game do you want to build?
