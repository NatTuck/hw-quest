Finish trying to get sbrk to replace malloc / realloc / free.

- First, make it work with just sbrk (manually reallocate).
- Then, conclude that free / real realloc is hard.

Look at how sbrk works with the syscall actually being brk. Look at the
bottom of the manpage to see how to get current brk.

Overflow:

- Start talking about data structures in C.
