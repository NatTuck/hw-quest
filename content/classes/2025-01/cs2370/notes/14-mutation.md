Design:

 - Add one to each item in a list.
 - Add one to each item in a list, in place.
   - ```for ii in range(len(xs)):```

Distraction:

 - Let's make a grid of colored cells.

Concepts:

 - Mutation
 - Mutability
   - List are, tuples aren't.
 - Pass by value vs. reference
   - Unexpected mutation
 - Nested mutation
 - Reassignment
