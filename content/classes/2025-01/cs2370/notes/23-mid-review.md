## Why write computer programs?

 - Computers run the world
 - Programs run the computers
 - Code vs. Law
   - Automatic speed limits vs. police judgement
   - DRM on movies vs. fair use


## Software Setup

 - Most dev environments take some setup.
 - We're specifically using a python setup with
   - The miniconda package manager.
   - The Spyder editor / IDE
   

## Python code

Overview:

 - A series of statements
 - Executed in order, top to bottom
   - import statements cause code from other files to run
 - Execution of blocks (indented code after a colon) may be conditional
   or delayed.
 - Functions are an important case of delayed code blocks
 - Most of the execution order of a program is about a bunch of
   functions calling each other.

Parts of Speech:

 - Literals
 - Operators
   - Arithmetic of numbers and strings
 - Function calls
 - Expressions vs. statements

Control flow:

 - If / Else
 - While
 - For-each
 - For-range


## Design Recipe

Core steps:

 - Stub with names
 - Purpose statement
 - Types
 - Tests
 - Standard pattern
 - Body

Standard patterns:

 - Atomic data; boring.
 - More complex data, two basic cases:
   - What do we do with a list?
   - How do we build a list to return?
 

## Data

 - Lists
 - Tuples / Structs
 - Sets
 - Dictionaries
   - Quick dictionary review


## Graphical programs with the sim library

## Computational complexity

 - There's more than one way to do it.
 - If you do it too slow a way, you're wasting resources.
 - If you do it too complicated a way, you're wasting other resources.
 

## Next topics

 - A little more with dictionaries
 - Classes and methods
 - Then, we're going to try to solve a hard problem.
