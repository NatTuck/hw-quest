## Longest Word

 - Plan:
   - Read /usr/share/dict/words into an array.
   - Make an array of lengths.
   - index of longest
   - We'll use malloc for everything
 - Makefile first.
   - gcc command
   - clean rule
   - tabs
 - Get distracted by:
   - Standard library functions and headers:
     - stdio.h: printf, fscanf, fgets
     - stdlib.h: atol
     - math.h: ceil, sqrt -- show manpage, talk about libm
   - Casts. For numbers, these convert.
