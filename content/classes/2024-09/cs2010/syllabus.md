<blockquote>
<b>Course Catalog:</b><br>
To explore some topical applications and technologies such as
robotics, artificial intelligence, and networking, examines some of
the fundamental aspects of computing, including how a computing
machine stores, manipulates, and transforms numbers, words, images,
and sounds, changing them from mere data into useful information;
strategies for solving computational problems (algorithmic thinking);
expressing computational solutions in various computer languages from
assembly through icon-driven graphical languages (4GLs); historical,
social and theoretical issues. Includes a weekly hands-on lab through
which students experience a variety of computing environments.

**Labs**

Each week there will be a lab assignment to complete during the lab
period. Labs will only be accepted before the end of the lab period,
and only when submitted from a lab workstation.

This course is a pre-requisite for several other courses. Labs are
intended to help you personally practice specific skills without
outside help.

Towards that end:

 - Personal electronics may not be used. If they are brought to
   lab, they must be kept in a closed container like a backpack.
 - Only approved web resources can be used. That includes the course
   web site, the textbook, the LMS, and nothing else unless explicitly
   listed in the assignment.
 - Students who intentionally or repeatedly violate this policy will
   be asked to leave and will not be able to complete that lab
   assignment.

**Homework**

Each week there will be a homework assignment to be completed outside
of class.

Minimizing the use of external resources is recommended, and academic
honesty rules will be strictly enforced.

**Quizzes**

There will be quizzes in lecture and/or lab throughout the semester.

**Attendence and Excused Absences**

Attendence is required for both lectures and labs.

If you are unable to attend class or submit homework due to a
circumstance covered by the university [Excused Absence Policy](
https://coursecatalog.plymouth.edu/university-policies-procedures/),
contact the professor by email to avoid losing attendence credit and
discuss options for making up missed work. If it is reasonably
feasible to send this email before the class you will miss you must do
so.

Your final grade in the class will drop by one letter grade after the
fourth unexcused absence.

**Late Work**

Work submitted after the assignment deadline will not be accepted.
Start early to guarantee you have enough time to complete your
homework assignments.

**Grade Appeals**

If you think you recieved an incorrect grade, send me an email
describing why your grade is wrong and how you think it should be
corrected.

If the grade isn't clearly wrong, I will ask you to stop by my office
hours so we can discuss the issue in more detail.

**Fair Grading Policy**

All grading in this class is subject to the university [Fair Grading Policy](
https://coursecatalog.plymouth.edu/university-policies-procedures/).

**Late Registration**

If you register late for the course please contact the professor to
discuss completing any missed assignments as soon as possible.

**Course Evaluations**

Course evaluations can be a valuable tool to determine how the
semester went. They're more useful with a higher response rate.

To encourage more responses, any student who completes their course
evaluation before the start of finals week will get a 5% bonus to
their final exam grade.

**Email**

Some communication about this class will be done through email
to your University address. Please check your email; you are
responsible for any email communications you miss.


# Resources

## Tutoring

There is evening tutoring in the lab classroom. See the course website
for more details. The [PASS Office](
https://www.plymouth.edu/academics/plymouth-academic-support-services)
also offers individual tutoring.

## Accomodations

Plymouth State University is committed to providing students with
documented disabilities equal access to all university programs and
facilities. If you think you have a disability requiring
accommodations, you should contact Campus Accessibility Services
(CAS), located in Speare (535-3300) to determine whether you are
eligible for such accommodations. Academic accommodations will only be
considered for students who have registered with CAS. If you have
authorized CAS to electronically deliver a Letter of Accommodations
for this course, please communicate with your instructor to review
your accommodations.

# Academic Integrity

Please carefully read and be familiar with the unversity [Academic
Integrity Policy](
https://coursecatalog.plymouth.edu/university-policies-procedures/).
Especially don't do any of the things in the list of examples of
academic integrity violations. Make sure to review the penalties for
repeated offenses.

The maximum penalty for academic dishonestly is a grade of "AF" in
this course. In addition, the student's name may be sumitted the the
appropriate university authorities for further diciplinary action
which may result in penalties up to dismissal from the University.

The most likely violation for this course is plagarism, which is when
a student submits a solution for an assignment that wasn't produced by
them (or their assigned team in the case of a group assignment). Both
submitting work that you didn't produce and providing solutions to
other students are unacceptable in this course and will result in a
penalty as described above.
