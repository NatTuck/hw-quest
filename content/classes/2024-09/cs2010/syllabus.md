<p><b>Course Catalog:</b><br>
To explore some topical applications and technologies such as
robotics, artificial intelligence, and networking, examines some of
the fundamental aspects of computing, including how a computing
machine stores, manipulates, and transforms numbers, words, images,
and sounds, changing them from mere data into useful information;
strategies for solving computational problems (algorithmic thinking);
expressing computational solutions in various computer languages from
assembly through icon-driven graphical languages (4GLs); historical,
social and theoretical issues. Includes a weekly hands-on lab through
which students experience a variety of computing environments.
