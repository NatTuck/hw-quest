## Algorithms

An algorithm is a sequence of steps to accomplish something.

Example:

 - Boil 6 cups of water in pot
 - Stir in macaroni, boil 6 to 8 minutes
 - drain, do not rinse, return to pot
 - add 1/4 cup butter, 1/4 cup milk, and cheese sauce mix
 - mix well

Ambiguity?

Textbook definition of algorithm:

A well-orderecd collection of unabigiously and effectively
computable operations that, when executed, produces a result
and halts in a finite amount of time.

 - Well-ordered collection?
 - Effectively computable?
 - Produces a result?
 - Halts in finite time?
