Fundamentals First Day


## Hello

 - This is Computing Fundamentals
 - I'm Nat Tuck
 - Course site at https://homework.quest/ then click "cs2010"
 - For this class, that's mostly but not entirely a link to Canvas.
 - Attendence

## Computing Fundamentals

 - What's "computing"?
 - Broadly, the study of stuff you can do with a computer.
 - What's a "computer"?
 - Let's go for a narrow definition for the moment:
   - An eletronic device that can run computer programs
   - Programmable: Exactly what it does depends on what program
     it's given
 - What can a computer program do?
 - What can't a computer program do?
 - How, practically, do we write computer programs to do things?
 - Those are typically "Computer Science". 
 - How, practically, do we run the programs we want to run to
   in a way that will help accomplish what we want to do?
 - A focus of that might be "Information Technology".
 - What if you stick arms, legs, or wheels on your computer?
 - That might be "Robotics", or it might just be "a car".

## Syllabus

 - Let's review the syllabus
 - Lab schedule is annoying:
   - Lab section 1 on Monday
   - Lab section 2 on Friday
   - That's always separated by a lecture
   - We've got one more monday off than Friday

## Why care?

 - Why do we want to learn about computing?
 - How many computers in this room?
 - Do you know anyone who doesn't use computers:
   - At work?
   - When not at work?
 - Interesting question: Who decides what program(s) a given computer
   will run.


## Parts of a Computer

 - CPU
 - Memory
 - Storage
 - I/O devices
   - Keyboard
   - Screen
   - Network interface

## Data

Computer hardware typically stores data as electrical signals that are
either off (zero volts) or on (detectibly more than zero volts).

That lets us store and process information in computers by interpreting
those siganls.

First step, we can think of an "off" signal as 0 and an "on" signal
as 1. We call one on or off value a "bit".

With more than one bit, it's possible to interpret the collection of
bits as a number with a greater range. For example, we can interpret
a pair of bits as one of four values:

 * 00 can be interpreted as the number 0
 * 01 => 1
 * 10 => 2
 * 11 => 3

With more bits, we can represent larger numbers.

Once we have numbers, we can go through another layer of
interpretation to represent letters using numbers.

 * 1 can be interpreted as A
 * 2 can be interpreted as B
 * etc

It's important to keep in mind that at each step these are somewhat
arbitrary choices. We could just as well decide that

 * 65 is A
 * 66 is B
 * 67 is C
 * etc

Which is closer to how most modern computer system actually do it.

Going further, there are various ways to represent images, sound, videos, and
computer programs as sequences of bits.

Importantly, there's typically multiple options for how to represent
data, and those options have advantages and disadvantages.


## Algorithms

An algorithm is a sequence of steps to accomplish something.

Example:

 - Get a large mixing bowl
 - Add 1.5 cups of flour
 - Add 3.5 teaspoons of baking powder
 - Add 1 tablespoon of sugar
 - Mix the ingredients
 - Add 1.25 cups of milk
 - Add 3 tablespoons of melted butter
 - Add one egg
 - Mix
 - Add one scoop to frying pan.
 - When holes form on top, flip.
 - When done cooking, remove.
 - Repeat until out of batter.
 - Serve

Ambiguity?

Textbook definition of algorithm:

A well-orderecd collection of unabigiously and effectively
computable operations that, when executed, produces a result
and halts in a finite amount of time.

 - Well-ordered collection?
 - Effectively computable?
 - Produces a result?
 - Halts in finite time?
