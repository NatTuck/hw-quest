Today:

 - You should have BadDate deployed and with several features implemented.
 - It's time to pick our projects for the rest of the semester.


# Project Ideas

 - Podcast Binge
   - A podcast player
   - Optimized for listening to entire podcasts
   - Recommend to a friend (whole podcast, episode)
 - Crazy Chess
   - A 2 player chess game where players can rearrange their pieces
     before they start playing.
   - Maybe buy pieces for points? Fairy chess pieces?
 - Local classifieds app.
   - Think Craiglist
   - But with location awareness, instant messaging, and notifications
 - Work on interactive JS graphics component for Inkfish
   - App framework exits
   - New feature that doesn't nessisarily require messing with
     other components too much
   - Might try to use on real students during this semester
