## Overflow: Scrum


A frequent question is: This Agile stuff is nice and all, but what are
we supposed to do?

Scrum is a concrete set of procedures to follow to try to get the
benefits of the Agile ideas. When do you talk to the customer? How do
you get working software? How do you get work done if you're
responding to change?

In Scrum, you divide development up in to one or two week "sprints".
For a sprint:

 - The team starts with a working program.
 - Each team member has tasks to work on.
 - Everyone completes their tasks.
 - That work is merged together into a new working program.
 - There are specific meetings and stuff.
 - There are administrative team members with roles like talking to
   the customer and assigning tasks.
 
This can work well or this can work poorly. It can make it easier for
managers to micromanage. It certainly makes a lot of money for
professional Scrum Consultants.

If you don't have a working program with new stuff after each sprint,
if sprints regularly extend longer than two weeks, or the developers
never talk directly to the custoemr, that's a bad sign for a Scrum
setup.

## Team Meetings

Pick Teams:

 - Before we can do meetings, we need teams
 - Let's figure out teams
   - Virtual server experience
   - Web dev experience
   - Maybe team captains and sportsball picks?


General meeting sequence:

 - Pick notetaker
 - For each member:
   - What have you done?
   - Are you blocked waiting for someone else to do something?
 - Group: Figure out tasks
 - Anything need discussion? 
   - Design questions?
   - Administrative choices?
 - Does everyone have stuff to do?


## Basic Concept: Git & Github

 - Distributed version control
   - Version control 
   - Distributed 
 - Repositories
 - Branches
 - Feature branches
 - Pull requests
 - Forks
 - Code reviews
