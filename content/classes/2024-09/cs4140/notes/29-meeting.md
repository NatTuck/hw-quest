Today:

 - Everyone team should have some functionality working.
 - Meetings
 
By next meeting, each student should complete a story that:

 - Adds beneficial functionaly to the project.
 - Has clearly testable acceptance criteria.

I'll be manually checking those features by working through the
documented acceptance test process when grading next week's reports.
