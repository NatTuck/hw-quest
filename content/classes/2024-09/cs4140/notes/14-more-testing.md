## Finish the tests from last time

 * Every story we implement should have at least one automated test
   that confirms that we've done something (at least if possible).
 

## Where should we be?

 * Your team's practice app should be deployed.
 * Each team member should have completed one story in the past week.
 * Each team member should have code reviewed and merged one story completed
   by another developer in the past week.
 * Each team member should have acceptance tested one story after it's deployed.
 * Your team shouild have four stories in the completed column of Taiga

Next week, you should do four more, execpt now they should have tests.


## Meeting

 * Is anyone blocked from being able to work on the app?
   * Local dev setup with Phoenix and an editor?
   * Figured out Git and Github?
   * etc
 * Come up with four new stories for next week.
 * Check if your practice app domain is accessible on a phone, if not, why not?
 * Check if it's accessible from the school network.
 * If practice app is blocked, submit a ticket to ET&S.
   * Your name.
   * Domain that is blocked.
   * "I'm in CS4140 with Professor Nathaniel Tuck and I'm using this
     recently registered domain for classwork, etc."
 * cs4140.party should now be unblocked, and is a good place to have
   team discussions
