Now:

 - We've only got a few weeks left, it's time to look at what functionality
   should be done for final presentations.
   
Next week:

 - Everyone should have another story done with a test procedure.
 - All remaining major features should have stories posted on Taiga
 - A final polish story should be up on Taiga, describing minor
   functionality that would be needed for a shippable MVP.
