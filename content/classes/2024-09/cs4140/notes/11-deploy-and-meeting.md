   - How do you score matches to determine how good or bad they are?
   - What sort of functionality does your app need?
 - Add some stock user stories and assign them to developers:
   - As a user, I should see matches and be able to react to them in some way.
   - As a user, I should be able to send messages to other users.
   - As a user, I should be able to answer extra profile questions and then
     later edit them.
