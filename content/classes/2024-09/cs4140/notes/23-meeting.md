Today:

 - You should have your main project deployed and with several features implemented.
 - You will lose points for failure to do stuff.

Staring next week:

 - Everyone participating will be fully enforced.
 - If you don't do at least one story and a PR each week, you get a zero
   on your individual report.
 - You'll get 5 points off on your team report for each student
   without a concrete contribution to the project that week -
   typically a merged PR.
 - You'll get 5 points off on your team report for each student that
   wasn't at least assigned a new story that week.
