Last time we started deploying Party Animal.

 - Finish deploy?


# Team Meeting

Practice App:

 - Our practice app is going to be "Bad Date", a dating app that does an
   intentionally bad job at suggesting matches while trying to avoid
   being too obvious about it.

Right now:

 - Everyone should be on https://cs4140.party
 - Create a Taiga.io account
   - Create a Bad Date project for your team.
 - Github: Group?
