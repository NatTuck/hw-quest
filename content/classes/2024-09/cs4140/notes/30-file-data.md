Two teams need to deal with file data:

 - GregsList needs image uploads.
 - BingeCast needs MP3 files.
 
Towards this end I'm going to review what a file is and how to deal
with it in both Elixir and JS.

Elixir:

 - bin_write / read
 - Temp uploads
 - Copying file
 - Uploads directory
 

JS:

 - FileReader
 - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/audio
 - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/URI/Schemes/data
