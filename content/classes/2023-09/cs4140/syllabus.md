## Student Learning Outcomes

Successful students will: 

 - Work in a team to develop a complex web application.
 - Publish the resulting application as a public git repository
   released under an open source license.
 - Use a selection of specific tools, techniques, and methodologies
   for software engineering, software development, and project
   management.
 - Engage in self-directed learning to gain knowlege and experience
   with new web development languages, frameworks, libraries, and
   tools.
 - Discover project tasks and break large tasks down into smaller pieces.
 - Contribute to allocation of tasks between team members then
   personally do a fair share of the work.
 - Deploy to a commodity virtual private server.
 - Collect and implement user stories from a person outside the team.

## Texts

There is no required textbook ðŸª³ for this course.

## Course Supplies

In an early task, each student will be required to purchase the
following services and maintain them for remainder of the semester:

 - A commodity virtual private server
 - A domain name
 
This can be done for under $20 for the semester.

Please wait to get these until the task is assigned, as there are
several specific requirements.

## Software Project

In this course you will work in a team to build a software project.

For the first phase of the course, we will introduce the tools and
processes we will be using for development by working on a simple
example application.

For the second phase of the course, each team will work on an
application for a "customer" outside the team. These may be actual
external people outside the class, it may just be the instructor, or
it may be a mix of the two.

In this second phase, teams will use a simple agile methodology to
make as much progress as they can on the application before the
semester ends while following the class development policies. New
development policies will be introduced in lectures throughout the
semester.

A major focus of this class is on the elements of software development
other than writing application code, so expect those things to take a
significant portion of your time and effort in this class.

The number of points available in an assessment may (or may not)
exceed the denominator used in the grade calculation.

**Letter grades**

&ge; 93 &rarr; A, &ge; 90 &rarr; A-, <br>
&ge; 87 &rarr; B+, &ge; 83 &rarr; B, &ge; 80 &rarr; B-, <br>
&ge; 77 &rarr; C+, &ge; 73 &rarr; C, &ge; 70 &rarr; C-, <br>
&ge; 67 &rarr; D+, &ge; 63 &rarr; D, &ge; 60 &rarr; D-, <br>
else (&lt; 60) &rarr; F

**Team and Individual Reports**

For this class you will be primarily working in a team of around 3-5
students. Your team will submit a weekly report answering questions
and summarizing course work and progress. The team will get one grade
on this report, reflecting an evaluation of both the report itself and
the work it describes.

In addition to the weekly team report, each student will submit an
individual report. Each student will recieve a grade on their own
report, reflecting the report itself and their individual
contributions as reported by themselves and their teammates.

Report templates will be provided through an online system called
Inkfish. All assignments must be submitted through that system.
Unsolicited emailed assignments will not be accepted.

Each week there may be assigned tasks or new project requirements
which will be reported on in one or both of that week's reports. Not
doing the task or managing the requirement will lose you points.
Claiming in a report that you did tasks or managed requirements when
you did not loses double points.

**Final Presentation**

At the end of the semester each team will give a presentation on what
they accomplished during the semester. The grade for this will cover
both the presentation itself and the work it describes.

A component of this grade may be from peer evaluations.

**Team Meeting Attendence**

Class each Friday will include a mandatory team meeting. If we don't
have class Friday, the meeting is the following Monday.

Each student starts with four points. Unexcused absenses lose a point.

Example: Having 7 unexcused absences from team meetings gives you a
score of -3 out of 4. So if you earn 100% in the other categories your
final grade will be an 82.5.

**Grade Appeals**

If you think you recieved an incorrect grade, send me an email
describing why your grade is wrong and how you think it should be
corrected.

If the grade isn't clearly wrong, I will ask you to stop by my office
hours so we can discuss the issue in more detail.

**Fair Grading Policy**

All grading in this class is subject to the university [Fair Grading Policy](
https://coursecatalog.plymouth.edu/university-policies-procedures/).

**Late Work**

Work submitted after the deadline loses 1% per hour late.

If you are unable to submit an assignment on time due to a
circumstance covered by the university [Excused Absence Policy](
https://coursecatalog.plymouth.edu/university-policies-procedures/)
then you can request an extension. If you are granted an extension and
submit by the extended deadline then the late penalty will be removed.
If such an extension could reasonably be requested before the
assignment deadline then it must be.

**Late Registration**

If you register late for the course please contact the professor to
discuss completing any missed assignments as soon as possible.

**Course Evaluations**

Course evaluations can be a valuable tool to determine how the
semester went. They're more useful with a higher response rate.

To encourage more responses, each class has the chance to earn a 1%
bonus to everyone's final grade. This bonus applies if at least 75%
of the students complete their evaluations by 10am on the Monday
of finals week.

# Accomodations

Plymouth State University is committed to providing students with
documented disabilities equal access to all university programs and
facilities. If you think you have a disability requiring
accommodations, you should contact Campus Accessibility Services
(CAS), located in Speare (535-3300) to determine whether you are
eligible for such accommodations. Academic accommodations will only be
considered for students who have registered with CAS. If you have
authorized CAS to electronically deliver a Letter of Accommodations
for this course, please communicate with your instructor to review
your accommodations.

# Academic Integrity

Please carefully read and be familiar with the unversity [Academic
Integrity Policy](
https://coursecatalog.plymouth.edu/university-policies-procedures/).
Especially don't do any of the things in the list of examples of
academic integrity violations.

For the projects in this class you will be developing software source
code and making the results publicly available.

To avoid plagarism, the following are clearly OK:

 - If a member of your team wrote code.
 - If a member of your team generated boilerplate code with a non-AI
   code generation tool (e.g. scaffolding in Ruby on Rails).
 - Using external open source libraries through package management
   tools.

Copying code from other sources is OK if you provide clear attribution
and:

 - The code is a documentation sample clearly intended to be adapted
   and used by developers.
 - The code is licensed under an open source license compatible with
   your project license. Make sure to follow the license.
 - Attribution should be identify the author if possible, how to
   find the resource (e.g. URL, book citation, etc), and any relevent
   licensing info.

Using code produced by generative AI is OK as long as:

 - You specify what generative AI tool (e.g. name, url, version, date
   as appropriate) was used for what code.
 - You include the full prompt, chat session, or whatever used to
   generate the code in a comment or in a documentation file.

Not OK:

 - Copying code you didn't produce yourself into your project without
   clear attribution.
 - Copyright infringement (including for non-code assets)
 - Getting people not on your team to write code for you or writing
   code for other teams, except in the case of an open source library
   included through a package manager.
