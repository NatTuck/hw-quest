Sw Eng First Day:

## Hello

 - Hello
 - What's "Software Engineering"?
 - Attendence

## Syllabus

Some thoughts:

 - You should show up for everything, but missing
   meeting days has a grade penalty.
 - Grading is indirect, through reports.
 - Tasks and requirements will be mentioned in class
   and announced via some mechanism.
 - With 7 students we'll probably end up with two teams.
 - Who's done full stack web dev?

## Topic

 - Mass production vs hand crafting
 - What's "Agile"?

## Extra Discussion

 - We probably want persistent chat.
