## Lab Sequence

Lab Periods are on Tuesdays, which is near the beginning of the week.

Lab assignments are due the following Monday at midnight.

Old Labs:

 1. Intro: 
    Writing code, JavaDoc, Pair Class, Constructor, Style (indentation), Declaring
    Fields, Unit Tests, toString method, Getters, Generics, equals method, 
	submitting work
 1. Implement a Generic Array:
    Arrays, Generics, Object, Casting, Getters, Setters
 1. Implementing a Linked List:
    Provides recursive toString, write recursive set
 1. Build a Stack:
    push, pop, pop throws on empty, peek, should peek throw?, should peek return null?,
	use stack to convert infix to postfix, Java stdlib: (Scanner, StringTokenizer),
	recommends building on ArrayList
 1. Build a Queue: 
    Build without any stdlib data classes, method signatures provided, simulate
	queuing network router, text input and output
 1. Build a Priority Queue:	
	Comparator interface, method signatures provided, addSmallestTwo, orange picking
 1. Build a Set:
    Immutable type, ArrayList for elements, copy to modify, Iterable vs List interfaces,
	method signatures provided, bonus points for recursive powerset
 1. Build a Binary Search Tree:
    calc height, traversal methods (preOrder, postOrder, inOrder), lab variant include
	toString, StringBuilder, least common ancestor
 1. Build a Graph (undirected, integer vertices):
    method signatures provided
 1. Build a HashMap:
    method signatures provided, quickly move to *using* the built-in HashMap,
	voting example, zombie example
 1. Build a Splay Tree (bonus):
    method signatures provided

Labs:

 1. Hello Java
 1. Structure Types, Nested Structures
 1. Linked Lists, Generics
 1. Arrays, ArrayList (then Midterm)
 1. Stacks (LinkedList vs ArrayList)
 1. Queues (Two Lists vs. Circular Buffer Variants)
 1. Binary Tree
 1. HashMap
 1. Set, BST
 1. Priority Queue
 1. Graph
 1. Network GUI Game
