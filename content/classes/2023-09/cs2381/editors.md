## Traditional Editors

The two traditional programmer's editors are [Vim](https://neovim.io/)
and [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/). Either is
recommended. Keep in mind that these programs require some effort to
set up and learn, but generally provide more flexibility than other
options.
