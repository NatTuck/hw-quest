Stuff for today:

 - Sign up for Inkfish
 - Teams
 - Introduce Lab 01
   - Show the solution running
   - Download and unpack starter code
   - Run the starter code
   - Open the starter in VSCode
   - Describe assignment

If we have software:

 - Show how to set up VSCode 
 - Show how to pack and unpack aarchives.
 - Get teams started.
 
If we don't have software:

 - Show how to pack and unpack software.
 - Talk about file heirarchy and show opening code in Notepad
 - We can't actually run stuff - no Java or Maven

Anyway, talk about setting up for dev on personal machine:
 
 - VS Code (>= 1.78)
 - OpenJDK >= 17
 - Strawberry Perl (>= 5.32 64 bit)
 - Apache Maven (>= 3.9.4)

On Debian/Ubuntu/Minut Linux, that's:

 - vscodium or VS Code
 - the ```openjdk-17-jdk``` package
 - the ```perl``` package, and some libraries as needed (Foo::Bar is generally libfoo-bar-perl)
 - the ```maven``` package

And either work or wrap early.
